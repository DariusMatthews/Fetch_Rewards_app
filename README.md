# Fetch Rewards Code Test

### [Live Web App](https://dariusmatthews.github.io/Fetch_Rewards_app/)
### [Github Repo](https://github.com/DariusMatthews/User-Task-App)

## Challenge Criteria

Please write an web app that retrieves the data from Fetch Rewards API. This will return a json array of items. Using this list of items, display all the items grouped by "listId" to the UI. Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying. Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null. The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.

## Tools Used

I used the Javascript library React to build this app. Material UI and SCSS was used to style the app and I used the JS fetch API to make the API call.
